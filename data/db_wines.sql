They did multiple fermentations, most in concrete but some in stainless steel without temperature control-as the grapes were cooled down-and with indigenous yeasts. They used around 10% full clusters. Some 60% of the volume matured in concrete for nine months, while the rest was in used 500-liter oak barrels and one new 4,500-liter oak foudre. This has even less color than the 2015, and feels sharp, a little raw, very volcanic and peppery, and it feels like there\'s one extra step in complexity and depth here. The palate is really nice, electric and, curiously enough, seems sharp, but at the same time, it has volume.

A rich and complex nose with plentiful dark fruit aromas, hints of coffee, cocoa and roasted hazelnut. On the palate, there is a lovely tension between sweet, dried fruits and a much juicier, firm cherry character. A wine of high alcohol content, it\'s intense and mouth-filling with a sheen of tannin. Finishes with remarkable length - absolutely mesmerizing. If you are a fan of Barolo, you will love this wine.\n\nTre Bicchieri - Gambero Rosso 2019\n\n4 out of 4 - Vitae Guide 2019\n\n\"The 2015 Sfursat di Valtellina Fruttaio Ca\' Rizzieri is made from a special selection of Chiavennasca (or Nebbiolo) grapes that are air-dried on mats in the traditional fruttaio Ca\' Rizzieri building located 500 meters above sea level. Mountain breezes fuel steady ventilation and keep the clusters healthy. The wine is fermented in barrique and aged in new oak for up to 18 months with an additional year in bottle. This is a mid-weight wine that offers loads of power (with 15.5% alcohol) that spreads clear over the palate. It shows dried berry aromas of cassis and cranberry with subtle tones of bacon fat and campfire ash at the back. This is the proverbial apr`es-ski wine to warm your bones after a long day outdoors in the snow.\"\n\n94 points - Monica Larner, Wine Advocate, Dec 2018\n\n \n\n> Learn More', '$79.00', 'https://www.wineonline.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/276x359/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/f/r/fruttaio-fronte_1.jpg', 'Rare', 'https://www.wineonline.ca/wine-cellar/rare-wines/sfursat-fruttaio-ca-rizzieri-docg-by-aldo-rainoldi-2015.html'),
